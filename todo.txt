=======		going to do		======

	first to do
		let the split skip the spaces ==find an other methode to free the splited line ==
		check if you put next to NULL in tmp 
	finish parsing
		free reading (when checking spaces)
		free objects pasams (when afecting objects) == not yet ==
		free object and rays at_the end				== not yet ==
		multiple objects :
			test multiple objects of the same object

	makefile
	parssing
		linked list	
			plan					== done ==
			square					== done ==
			sphere					== done == 
			triangle				== done	==
			camera 					== done == 
			cylindeer				== done ==
			free globals its easy 	== done ==
	
	test likned list adding and delitin;														==done==

	=== do this first === fix multiple objects problem ==										==done==
						  === move to shadow ==
	first to do check camera	(you maight test switich to vector directly for forward vector) ==done==
	
	ask about free and exit 																	==done=	
	
	triangle try to fix ro chagnge 						 										==done==

	fix cylinder or change the algorithm look for traore 										==done==

	fix camera vectors																			==done==
	
	multiple objects 																			==read==

	shadow																						==needs a fix==
