			camera == done not tested ==
			plan	== not tested ==
			square == not tested ==
			sphere == == 
			cylindeer ==not finieshed yet==
			test multiple objects of the same object

	makefile

	test likned list adding and delitin;														==done==

	=== do this first === fix multiple objects problem ==										==done==
						  === move to shadow ==
	first to do check camera	(you maight test switich to vector directly for forward vector) ==done==
	
	ask about free and exit 																	==done=	
	
	triangle try to fix ro chagnge 						 										==done==

	fix cylinder or change the algorithm look for traore 										==done==

	fix camera vectors																			==done==
	
	multiple objects 																			==read==

	shadow																						==needs==
